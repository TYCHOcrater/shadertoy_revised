# shadertoy_revised

this is a offline shadertoy revised version for myself, i implemented a glsl sandbox looking for orginal shadertoy. 
you can place that php based web project on your own web server.

the new glsl sandbox looking as showed below, additionally i added a gallery page as a place to show your all saved 
outstanding vfx's and etc. shader code is hided by defualt, tricky method to show code editor is concating &sh=0
